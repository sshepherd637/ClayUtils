# ClayUtils
A collection of code snippets that have been butchered/altered/edited to allow for the creation of different Clay Minerals.

## General Purpose
This repository houses what I lovingly call a `lump' of code that I have been adding to and creating for very specific, niche purposes over the course of around 4 years. I'm uploading it in the hopes that if might have someone some headache if they also encounter similar problems as myself when carrying out computational research into these systems. Currently, I have managed to find the following code snippets from a very unorganised machine. 

### Misc
Contains a file detailing a couple of functions that handle generic, everyday things like box generation and system printing. 

### SystemCreation
Code blocks that generate clay systems.

### SystemEditing
Code blocks that edit and manipulate already generated clay systems.
